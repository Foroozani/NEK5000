## NEK5000

`NEK5000` is a fast and scalable high-order solver for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) 
 

Create a 2D mesh as I explened here:
[NEK5000](http://nek5000.github.io/NekDoc/tutorials/conjht.html)

and run a test case [see here](https://github.com/Foroozani/MyLecturesNote). 

In this part, We studied 3D conjugate heat transfer in a cylinder. The implemented subroutine can be fined at cyl.usr file.
