# NEK5000
A fast and scalable high-order solver for computational fluid dynamics
 

Create a 2D mesh as I explened here:
[NEK5000](http://nek5000.github.io/NekDoc/tutorials/conjht.html)

and run a test case. 

In this part, We studied 3D conjugate heat transfer in a cylinder. 
The implemented subroutine can be fined at cyl.usr file.
